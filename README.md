## PURPOSE
Tired of staying in queues in university where everyone was trying to get in without a queue. So I decided to make an app for it.

This app works as a web site.

### Technology stack: 
  - `React` 
  - `Node.js (Express)` 
  - `sequelize` as ORM 
  - `PostgreSQL`
## HOW TO RUN
1. Fill in the credentials in the `.env` file (there is an example)
2. ```docker-compose build```
3. ```docker-compose up```
4. Enjoy
